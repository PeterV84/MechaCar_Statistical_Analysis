## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

The Vehicle weight, Spoiler_angle and AWD all have the a non random amount of variance. The Ground_clearance and the vehicle length provided the most variance.

# Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The P-Value is less than 0 so there is no slope

# Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
The R-squared is almost 72% which would make the prediction of mpg effective.
